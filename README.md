# Hash Code 2019

Curr solution:
* Slices upper left coordinate assigned sequentially
* Random exploration policy when expanding the slice
* Greedy

Things still to be done:
* Fix iterative check for better solutions
* Additional logic to allow non-compliant slices to overlap with other slices which have more than enough resources
* 2D map to visualize input & solution
* ...
